            This is what Alice's context window looks like. A system prompt, her
            identity, and the tools available to her — list, create, and approve
            expenses. And there's a bearer token — a JWT — that authorises API
            calls on her behalf.
            <br /><br />{CLICK}<br /><br />
            But what if an attacker extracted that token? It's right there in
            the context window. They could use it from anywhere, for any amount
            within the limit, until it expires.

            This is the problem we need to solve. The API enforces Alice's
            limits, so the LLM can't just approve anything. But bearer tokens
            can be stolen and reused by anyone.

            Here's what a poisoned tool response looks like. The agent calls a
            calendar MCP server — totally normal.

            But look at the notes field. Buried in legitimate meeting prep text

            The agent asked for calendar data — it got an injection payload for

            The payload is hiding in a field the agent has to read.
            <br /><br />{CLICK}<br /><br />
            And this is the fundamental problem: the LLM processes everything in
            context the same way. It can't reliably distinguish data it should
            read from instructions it should execute.

            Bearer tokens. A bearer token is like a concert ticket. Whoever has
            it can use it. That's by design - "bearer" means "whoever bears this
            token." Let me prove it.

            My entire attack relied on one thing: the LLM believed my claims
            without proof. Verifiable Credentials make claims provable. That's
            the fundamental shift.
            <br /><br />
            And remember the LLM's wish list from earlier? Professional
            verification, consistency checking, intent transparency, peer
            attestation. Verifiable Credentials deliver all of it.

            did:key is universal — great for testing. did:web has the broadest
            enterprise support. did:ion has mixed support — Microsoft removed it
            for tenant configuration but still uses it internally for holder
            wallets. And did:cheqd — this is a new one. cheqd is a Cosmos-based
            network built specifically for verifiable credentials. It adds a
            payment layer — so issuers can charge for credential verification,
            which creates a sustainability model. Walt.id and cheqd's own
            tooling support it, but it's not yet in the big enterprise platforms
            like Entra or MATTR.

            For maximum interoperability today, did:web is your best choice.

            Here's the comparison. Look at the attack surface. JWT-only has
            reusable tokens and replay risk. Credential-protected: no credential
            means no access, tokens are single-use, and nonces block replay.

          <p>EU AI Act — automatic logging for high-risk AI systems</p>

            One more thing. The EU AI Act requires automatic logging for
            high-risk AI systems — and that includes AI making financial
            decisions, which is exactly what our expense agent does. The
            deadline is August 2026. If your AI agents can't prove who
            authorised what, you have a compliance problem.
            <br /><br />{CLICK}<br /><br />
            Verifiable Credentials give you that audit trail for free — log
            every presentation, document every constraint, and benefit from a
            full chain of trust from issuer to decision. Start building identity
            into your AI workflows now.
