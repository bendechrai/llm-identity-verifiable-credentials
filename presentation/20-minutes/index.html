          <aside class="notes">
            To use a Verifiable Credential, you create a Verifiable
            Presentation. You wrap the credential and sign it with your private
            key. This proves: "I am the holder. I possess the private key." The
            credential stays in your wallet. Only the presentation goes out.
            <br /><br />
            Where does the wallet live? It's separate from the DID. The wallet
            is software - could be a mobile app, browser extension, or a secure
            service. The critical part: the private key lives there, not
            accessible to the LLM. The DID like did:web is just the identifier -
            it points to where you can resolve the public key and verify
            signatures.

            The presentation passes through the agent to get a short-lived JWT
            from the auth server. But if an attacker exfiltrates that
            presentation - it's already been used, so it's rejected.
            <br /><br />{CLICK}<br /><br />
            Even if they could get a new JWT, it's restricted to the original
            scope and claims. If the attacker wants to authorize a different
            action, tey'd need a new presentation. And creating a new
            presentation requires Alice's private key, which lives in her
            wallet, not the LLM context.

            Four actors. Alice's Wallet holds her credential AND her private
            key. The LLM Agent. The Auth Server. The Expense API. Critical: the
            Verifiable Credential never leaves Alice's wallet.
            <br /><br />
            The agent needs to approve an expense. It asks the auth server what
            credentials are needed. The auth server responds with a request and
            a challenge nonce.
            <br /><br />
            The agent forwards the request to Alice's wallet. The wallet creates
            a Verifiable Presentation, signs it with Alice's private key,
            includes the nonce.
            <br /><br />
            That Verifiable Presentation is single-use. It contains the nonce
            and the domain. If an attacker exfiltrates it - nonce already used?
            Rejected. Wrong domain? Rejected. It's not a bearer token. It's a
            single-use ticket.

          <aside class="notes">
            The auth server does all the validation. Verifies signatures. Checks
            holder binding. Confirms the nonce. Checks if the credential is
            revoked. Extracts the claims.
            <br /><br />
            Then it issues a JWT. The scopes are determined by server-side
            policy based on the credential claims. Not by anything the agent
            requested. Short-lived - maybe 60 seconds.
            <br /><br />
            The agent doesn't decide what it's allowed to do. The auth server
            decides. There's no room for the LLM to "interpret" permissions or
            be convinced that limits are flexible. The policy is code on a
            server the LLM can't access.
            <br /><br />
            Finally, the agent calls the API with the constrained token. The API
            validates it and processes the request.
